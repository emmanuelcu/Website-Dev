        <h1>Use Case 1</h1>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I led the Product Design, the user experience, and the user interface designs of this project. 
            I also received feedback from other fellow designers to improve and get other perspectives about the design.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Build a mobile application that allows the user to register his/her fingerprint into the system. 
            The fingerprints are a new method to authenticate the clients to Telcel. This solution allows the clients
            to authorize, check movements, and change plans or payment methods with the company without showing any identification.
            It also helps the Client Executives (CE) to reduce the time they solve the problem or necessity from the client.
